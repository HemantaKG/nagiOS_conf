Follow the steps to configure nagios3 cluster monitoring tool:

step 1. Need a list of fully qualified names of all the hosts you want to monitor (/etc/hosts) as below 
10.0.0.1    master1   master1.alice.cluster.res
10.0.0.2    master2   master2.alice.cluster.res
10.0.0.11	  node1     node1.alice.cluster.res
10.0.0.12	  node2     node2.alice.cluster.res

step 2. Nagios must be installed on the machine running a web server (i.e. apache)
sudo apt-get install nagios3
NOTE: it ask's password for nagiosadmin user (give a stronge password)

step 3. Nagios drops configuration files into /etc/nagios3/conf.d/ as part of the base installation, (use those bases and template files for configuration Nagios)

step 4. create a file named "cluster-nagios.cfg" under configuration folder "/etc/nagios3/conf.d/"
NOTE: This file keeps entire cluster asscess or comunication related informations of each node of the cluster to communicate with the nodes for monitoring the states
cd /etc/nagios3/conf.d/
nano cluster-nagios.cfg

step 5. Next, try to start up (or restart) nagios
NOTE: the basic setup done

Advance configuration to monitor LOAD, CPU, USERS, IPMI, ect...
NOTE: look at the "/etc/nagios3/conf.d/localhost_nagios2.cfg" file

Other:
1. to change nagios3 passwd (that we set at step 2)
sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nagios2/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin
